FEBio Plugin

This plugin is based on the transversely isotropic Mooney Rivlin material in FEBio but adds a stress term based on the force-length-curve by Gordon et al. (1966) for the active contraction. With this plugin, you can easily change the muscle properties to accommodate different muscle types.
